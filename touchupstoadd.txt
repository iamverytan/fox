hi bren

some nitpicky details i want to fix (number of *s is how hard it will be):

DONE (*) feels like the font in the tab sidebar looks weird when hovered on

DONE (*) middle click on a tab deletes it in the sidebar, double click makes a duplicate. CHANGE TO middle click clones it in the same tree layer, double click does nothing

DONE (*) scrholling trhough tabs when hovering in sidebar

+ (**) figure out way to add new tab to branch you are in vs a new tab to the root of the tab tree

+ (**) change the default tab elements names and icons, and move to top

+ (*) move bookmarks and hisotry to top

+ (*****) change the visual/aesthetic of the firefox page when opening new window / tab

+ (***) making firefox windows smaller cramps up the navbar
